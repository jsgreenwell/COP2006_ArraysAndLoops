### Lists, Files, and Loops
Very basic intro into using ArrayLists to read and
load data from .csv files.

## Three Versions:

#### First
No file just simple Array vs. List operations (totaling).

#### Second
Adding in List of Ints to read in file (no csv just text).

#### Third
Final version uses a List of Lists (int) which reads and
splits data as you would see in a CSV file.
